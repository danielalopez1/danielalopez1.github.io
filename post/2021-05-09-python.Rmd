I really enjoyed using R Studio, and the thought of having to learn a whole new system stressed me out. Fortunately, the Reticulate package allows users to use R and Python together. 

```{r}
#R code
library(reticulate)
mydog <- "say hello to"
```

```{python}
#Python code
mydog="Canela"
print(r.mydog,mydog)
```

```{r}
#R code
cat(c(mydog,py$mydog))
```



Below is a photo of my dog, Canela!
